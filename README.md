# wage-visualization

INTRODUCTION
------------

Wage Visualization is a React app that allows user to create account, login information, and display visualized reports using D3 Javascript library.
The data comes from csvtojson npm package, it is a csv file called wage file.csv that has 10 columns. Each column is parsed into json format and gets transferred through express.js
to the front end for React to retrieve the data and display it on the D3 bubble chart.
